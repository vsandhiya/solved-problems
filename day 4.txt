#### Height Checker

A school is trying to take an annual photo of all the students. The students are asked to stand in a single file line in non-decreasing order by height. Let this ordering be represented by the integer array expected where expected[i] is the expected height of the ith student in line.

You are given an string with integer heights representing the current order that the students are standing in. Each heights[i] is the height of the ith student in line (0-indexed).

Return the number of indices where heights[i] != expected[i].

Input Format
The input format will be in string

Constraints
1 <= heights.length <= 100 1 <= heights[i] <= 100

Output Format
The output format will be in a integer

Sample Input 0
114213

Sample Output 0
3

Explanation 0
heights: [1,1,4,2,1,3] expected: [1,1,1,2,3,4] Indices 2, 4, and 5 do not match.

Sample Input 1
12345

Sample Output 1
0

Explanation 1
heights: [1,2,3,4,5] expected: [1,2,3,4,5] All indices match.

#### SOLUTION####


n=input()
txt=str(n)
user_input=list(txt)
order=sorted(user_input)

s=0
a=[]
for i in user_input:
    if i != order[s]:
        a.append(i)
    s+=1
    
count=0
for i in a:
    count+=1
print(count)



####Build an Array With Stack Operations

Given an string targets separated with hyphen '-' with an integer n separated by '#'. In each iteration, you will read a number from string.

Build the string number values using the following operations:

Push: Read a new element from the beginning of the string number values, and push it in the array. Pop: delete the last element from the string. If the target value in the string is already built, stop reading more elements. Return the operations to build the target array. You are guaranteed that the answer is unique.

Input Format

The input format is string

Constraints

1 <= target.length <= 100 1 <= target[i] <= n 1 <= n <= 100 target is strictly increasing.

Output Format
The output format is array

Sample Input 0
1-3#3

Sample Output 0
["Push","Push","Pop","Push"]

Explanation 0

Read number 1 and automatically push in the array -> [1] Read number 2 and automatically push in the array then Pop it -> [1] Read number 3 and automatically push in the array -> [1,3]

Sample Input 1
1-2#4

Sample Output 1
["Push","Push"]

Explanation 1
Explanation: You only need to read the first 2 numbers and stop

Sample Input 2
2-3-4#4

Sample Output 2
["Push","Pop","Push","Push","Push"]

n=input()
a=n.split("#")
bt=a[0]

dt=list(bt)

xt=bt[-1]

d=[]
x=int(xt)
for i in range(1,x+1):
    t=str(i)
    d.append(t)


z=[]
for i in d:
    if i in dt:
        z.append("Push")
    else:
        z.append("Push")
        z.append("Pop")
